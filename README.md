# Redirection Mandelbrot viewer
 Mandelbrot set viwer for redirection arcade.
 
## Mandelbrot set
The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers *c* for which the function *f(z)=z^2+c* does not diverge when iterated from *z=0*.  
In practice, one calculates a limited number of iterations. If in those iterations the magnitude grows beyond *2* we know the sequence diverges. Otherwise we assume it converges.  
In this arcade, the code responsible for telling wheter a given point lies inside or outside the set is
```
function isIn(x, y)
	zx, zy = 0, 0
	for i = 1, 80 do
		if zx*zx+zy*zy > 4 then
			return false
		end
		zx, zy = zx*zx-zy*zy+x, 2*zx*zy+y
	end
	return true
end
```
The whole set lies in the circle of *|z| <= 2 and looks like this

## Redirection robot arcade
Robot comprises 64Ã—64 B/W screen, 4 directional joystick and two buttons. These can be used to move around and zoom in/out on parts of the complex plane.  
In game it may look something like this

The whole code is very straightforward and less than 100 lines in Lua.
